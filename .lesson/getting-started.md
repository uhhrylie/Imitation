# Part 2: Responsive Design

For part 2, you will be creating a responsive design. That means creating a design that adapts and works well at different screen sizes.

The code in responsive is already set up to show you what screen size you are on by using media queries in CSS. You can read more about that technique [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp).

A responsive design will necessarily mean making your perfect design less perfect: you have to be flexible and allow for different screens, etc.

You can also think about how the page would look if translated, if the user blows the text up big using Control-+ to make it easier to read, or if a font doesn't load. The web is designed to be flexible and to accommodate all of these different use cases, and responsive design means making a design that works well under different scenarios.
